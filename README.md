## Challenge: Carbon Footprint


### Data

We have used labeled data https://github.com/NASA-IMPACT/space-apps/tree/master/data/labeled from NASA data resources.

Monitoring surface air quality helps ensure the protection of human health and property. However, surface air quality data is sparsely monitored. To help fill in these gaps, inferences are derived from other sources including remote sensing. The CSV formatted data and labels are provided below. It contains the following fields which have been described.

air_data_value: EPA air data PM2.5 readings
RH: relative humidity from HRRR
UGRD, VGRD: Wind speed vectors from HRRR
HPBL: Height of Planetary Boundary Layer from HRRR
TMP: Temperature recorded from HRRR
goes_measurement: AOD reading from GOES R

### Libraries

1. Pandas
2. Numpy 
3. Seaborn
4. Matplotlib
5. Sklearn

### Machine Learning Models

1. Linear Regression
2. Random Forest Reggresion
3. Decision Tree


### Detection Model

We are building a detection model with target variable as Temperature. Here we study variation of data with temperature.

## API Visualization

API url: "https://sreejagundu.github.io/NASA/"  
This url visualizes the temperature variations due to increase in GHG emissions. To visualize satellite data and variations of CO, CH4 and NO2, edit the 'layers' in path  NASA/GIBSapi/main.js/.


## Solution

Prepare a paint with artificial chloroplast as one of its constituent element.

Tint the paint on any outer surfaces like buildings, cars, etc.

Chloroplast will capture carbondioxide from the atmosphere. Further, it may be possible that it releases oxygen in presence of sunlight.

It can be used with basic knowledge and economically feasible.

This solution optimizes carbon footprints from environment in a eco-friendly way.
